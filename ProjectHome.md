This is the PC-side tool for the CASIMIR node - a miniature body worn sensor node used to monitor human activities and social interactions. This sensor include: orientation sensing (9DOF: accelerometer, magnetometer and gyroscope), audio recording, air pressure, temperature and light sensing, and radio-beacon-based proximity sensing.

This software allows:
  * Readout of the memory card containing CASIMIR data
  * Interactive control of the CASIMIR node
  * Aligment of CASIMIR data streams accross multiple devices
